# Human-Computer-Interface-using-augmented-reality
In this project, a proof-of-concept of a Human Computer Interface is developed using AR technology. The goal is to develop an immersive and interactive computing experience marking the end of physical screens and devices. This is done by using a cardboard style Head-Mounted Display and the users smartphone. Since this was an immersive experience, a more natural way of interaction was needed and hence using our very own hands was proposed. The hands of the user are tracked using external infrared sensors attached to front of the HMD.
